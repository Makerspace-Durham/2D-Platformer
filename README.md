## Storyline
TBD

## Project Structure
There are 4 main folders: Assets, Raw_Assets, Scenes, and Scripts.

### Assets
The assets folder with contain all of the sprites used(or not) for the game. It's contents will be split up into sub-directories based on it's in-game use.
As an example, Character sprite sheets will be stored in the characters sub folder. 

### Raw_Assets
This is where you will store the original files for sprites in case there's a need for edited by another dev/artist. There is no sub-directory for this folder.

### Scenes
This is where your created entities will be stored. This **INCLUDES** the scripts that go with the scene. 

### Scripts
This is primarily for global scripts or scripts that can be used as a base for something else.
